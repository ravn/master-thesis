\section{Can users transparently harness the power of XML for
webpublishing?}
\framepage{15cm}{
Discuss how users can use their current tools to publish information
to the web (Cactus principles:  data capture and automatic conversion)
by automatic conversion to XML and on-the-fly conversion on the way
out of the webserver (while still having access to the original file
provided by the user).   This also allows people to view files made
with software products not available to them.
