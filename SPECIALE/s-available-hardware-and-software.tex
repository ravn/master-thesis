\section{Available hardware and software}
\label{sec:availabe-hardware-and-software}

This section lists the hardware I have used during development of
Cactus.  


\subsection{Asserballe}
\label{sec:asserballe}

Urls in long banes for this.

\begin{itemize}
\item Pentium-S 133 MHz PC with 128 Mb RAM and 10 Gb IDE disk
\item Linux Redhat 6.1  
\item MySQL \textsf{2.3.?? - security updates}
\item Apache \texttt{1.??} with mod\_perl, ApacheJServ, Cocoon.
\item IBM JDK 1.1.8.
\item CGI, DBI::\textsf{???} perl modules for writing CGI scripts and
  accessing MySQL databases.
\end{itemize}

The choice of JDK was made at a time when \textsf{top bug at Javasoft}
was ``please provide a port of Java to Linux'', and where IBM beat Sun
to it by porting their Java 1.1.6 implementation to Linux.  The
benchmarks showed it to be as fast as their Windows and OS/2 ports,
which at that time was the fastest Just In Time compilers on the
PC-platform.  It performs very well on Linux, and the installed
version is just a maintainance upgrade.

MySQL and the corresponding JDBC driver \textit{must} be the latest
stable versions due to security and bug fixes.



\subsection{Aalborg}

(4-CPU UltraSparc 440MHz with Sun JDK 1.2)
