  Konsensus blablabla.

  Konsensus has not been implemented due to time constraints.

\framepage{15cm}{
  A project to implement community based OpenFAQ's, based on
  experience with the Danish Unix FAQ for FidoNet, and the long
  turnaround time for the OpenFAQ moderator.}

Found FAQ-O-Matic which basically provided the needed functionality.
Check if photo.net can provide similar functionality with the freely
available services.
