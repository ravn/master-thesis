  This thesis discusses database backed websites; their current use as
  presentation engines, construction, pros and cons, list the current
  state of the art software, and how web sites in general function as
  \textit{information presenters}.  Hereafter it is discussed how
  end-users best can utilize such a system, without giving up their
  current software, allowing such websites to be used to ease the
  distribution of information between users, and let the web site
  provide \textit{information sharing}.
  
  Technologies are discussed with an emphasis on Open Source software,
  and two sample programs - ``Cactus'' and ``Consensus'' are
  presented,  and discussed.  Cactus allows any user to do automated
  SSP on an Intranet without a human webmaster to convert documents
  and maintain links.  Consensus allows an open group of people to
  maintain a set of documents on a webserver.
