\framepage{15cm}{
The need for open, well-defined standards.  HTML, PDF, PNG (versus
GIF) RFC-things (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, MIME) good examples.  Word
counterexample (look for Bill Gates saying people can buy an upgrade
to read Word97 files in Word95).  Adobe has good documentation on
their PostScript and PDF document formats (doing theirs to have it
well supp orted).  HTML is widely documented in RFC.

\section{Why is Open Source essential?}
\framepage{15cm}{
Independence from hardware and software vendors, allowing free choice
of hardware platform and operating system, as well as the possibility
to fix bugs and use other products.  (Examples: XT versus Xerces, Java
Interpreter for Linux, servlet technologies, cheap - use money for
hardware instead of licenses).
