\section{DocBook considerations}
\textsf{\myurl{http://www.docbook.org}{DocBook} is a DTD designed for
documenting software.  Used by Sun, FreeBSD, O'Reilly and others.
}
\textsf{
The SGML is converted to HTML by applying a HTML style sheet for
DocBook, and sending it through jade with request for a sgml
conversion.  The stylesheet generates a HTML file pr section in a
chapter which is rather too much.  The HTML is \textit{very} ugly - all
induced line breaks are \textit{within} the tags to avoid introducing any
artificial whitespace.  The HTML is Lynx-compatible.
}

The generated navigation tags are a little troublesome in Lynx, but
nice in Netscape.  A ``up'', ``next'' and ``previous'' are available
combined with a ``Top title''-$>$''Chapter title'' -$>$ ``Section title''
navigation bar at the top.

The localization code is manually maintained.

Having XML files in DocBook format (basically having a valid DocBook
DTD) allow to use all the available DocBook stylesheets (both XSL and
DSSSL) to \textsf{??} them.  These are:

\begin{description}
\item[XSL] --
  \begin{description}
  \item[XHTML-1.0] -- 
  \item[HTML-\textsf{4.0}] -- 
  \item[XSL-FO] -- The W3 page description language.
    \textsf{Renderer? like fop and the commercial one}
  \item[\textsf{Others}] ?
  \end{description}
\item[DSSSL] --
  \begin{description}
  \item[RTF] -- Rich Text Format.  \textsf{Renderers?}
    
  \item[MIF] -- Frame format.   \textsf{What about it}
  \item[{\TeX}] -- Renders with the \textsf{JadeTeX} package.
  \item[\textsf{Others}] ?? What else can we do with this.
  \end{description}
\end{description}

Generally XSL conversions are fast enough to be done ``on-the-fly'',
where DSSSL conversions are \textsf{too slow for this (timing?)}.



\section{Converting documents to other formats}
\label{sec:docbook-converting-documents-to-other-formats}


\subsection{SGML to XML}
\label{docbook-converting-sgml-to-xml}

\begin{alltt}
  sx -biso-8859-1 -xlower input.sgml $>$ output.xml
\end{alltt}

The DTD for the document \textit{must} be registered in the
\textsf{catalog}.  Even so a number of warnings and errors may be
printed, since some SGML-constructions cannot be represented in XML,
and some entities are unknown.  This must be handled manually - SX is
not a tool do this perfectly.


\subsection{XML to RTF}
\label{sec:docbook-xml-to-rtf}

Use \texttt{jade} with the appropriate stylesheet and \textsf{....}

\begin{alltt}
         jade -t rtf -d docbook.dsl xml.dcl inputfile.xml
\end{alltt}

where \texttt{docbook.dsl} is one of the stylesheets from the
\textsf{DocBook Modular StyleSheets}
(\texttt{dsssl/docbook/print/docbook.dsl}) and \texttt{xml.dcl} comes
from the Jade distribution (\texttt{pubtext/xml.dcl})

The resulting RTF-file is compatible with Word-97, Word-95 (claimed by
author), StarOffice, \textsf{other texteditors} 

\textsf{other backends}
