\chapter{The DocBook ???}

DocBook is a DTD designed for documenting software.  Used by Sun,
FreeBSD, O'Reilly and others.

The SGML is converted to HTML by applying a HTML style sheet for
DocBook, and sending it through jade with request for a sgml
conversion.  The stylesheet generates a HTML file pr section in a
chapter which is rather too much.  The HTML is \_very\_ ugly - all
induced line breaks are \_within\_ the tags to avoid introducing any
artificial whitespace.  The HTML is Lynx-compatible.

The generated navigation tags are a little troublesome in Lynx, but
nice in Netscape.  A ``up'', ``next'' and ``previous'' are available
combined with a ``Top title''-$>$''Chapter title'' -$>$ ``Section title''
navigation bar at the top.

The localization code is manually maintained.
